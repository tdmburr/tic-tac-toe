### Abstract:
I created the game of Tic-Tac-Toe with an ocean theme. This game will allow a user to kick back and easily play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with two players on the same machine.

### Installation Instructions:
1. fork this repository
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. cd into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor


### Preview of App:

### Context:

This project took approximately 20 hours for a repeater in their 5th week, of their second inning, in Turing.


### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
1. Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
DRY JavaScript
2. event delegation to handle similar event listeners
3. Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
4. Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
5. Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge


### Wins + Challenges:
Wins: Being able to complete the project while still continuing to learn and use new methods and an iterator (forEach).

Challenges: Knowing where to start is always the hardest part. Some challenges arose connecting the DOM with the Data Model towards the end of the project.
